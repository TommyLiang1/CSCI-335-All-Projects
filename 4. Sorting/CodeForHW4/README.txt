All parts of the assignment is completed

I had trouble getting the quicksort2() and quicksort3() function in sort.h to work 
because the order is always incorrect when checked with verifyOrder().

I also had trouble debugging why all the functions weren't working on gradescope.
Apparently I had to implement the drivers in test_sorting_algorithms but I did so in
sort.h instead

To run the program:
	You can compile everything by typing 
		make clean
		make all
	To run each program individually
    () = choose any of the possibilities separated by a ','
		./test_sorting_algorithms (random, sorted_small_to_large, sorted_large_to_small) <integer> (less, greater)
		make clean
	You delete all .o files and executables.

Input files:
    N/a

End of Comments.

Note: the files test
test_sorting_algorithms.cc and Sort.h were provided by the professor.

However all the function implementations are also in the two files the professor provided
